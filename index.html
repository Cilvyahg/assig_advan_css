              Hello, my name is Cilvya and this is my second CSS Assignment. I
              have learned a lot about HTML, CSS and SASS already and hope to
              get better at it after time. I really love my coding journey so
              far and I am excited for what is yet to come. I enjoy coding, but
              sometimes I also feel as if I want to throw my laptop out of the
              window, but I guess that is something all developers go through.
              Can't wait to start with Javascript and React and make things on
              my page more interactive and playful.
            </p>
